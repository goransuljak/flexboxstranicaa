//// FLEXBOX SITE - TRILLO

flexbox is new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to one another, in different directions and orders,
the main idea behind flexbox is to give the conteainer the ability to expand and to shrink elements to best use all 
the available space

flexbox replaces layouts, using less and more readable and logical code
flexbox completely changes the way that we build one-dimensional layouts. Flexbox is a true revolution in CSS.
